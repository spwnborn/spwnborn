Gender & pronoun fluid, both change with kinshifts. Forever transmasc. Amateur artist and more amateur writer. I like making new connections, don't be afraid to approach me since I likely won't do that first (anxiety. ok). I am usually offtab so whisper to interact with me... or just add me on discord straight away, it's "spwnborn". Yume + multi shipper, I'd rather keep my yume(s) private for now (they are pretty on the nose bro😭🤤😢🥀😪). No DNI, I block freely.
